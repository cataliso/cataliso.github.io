Years ago, Marty Cagan wrote a paper on the role of the product manager. It’s a great read. It covers the role, responsibilities, and characteristics of good product managers, and ways to find and develop them. The paper could be used by colleagues who work with product managers to understand what they do and enhance their working relationships. It could also be used by executives who manage product managers to understand how to set expectations and drive career development. However, the paper best serves those who are already product managers or are thinking about becoming one. Let’s focus on the role and responsibilities of a product manager.

### **Role**

A product manager is the primary product owner. At Big Co. she plays a business strategy role, a mini-CEO. At a small startup, the product manager is a founder. Product managers are not program/project managers, marketing managers, developers, or customer support. Rather, they are big thinkers, market experts, and serve as the voice of customers.

### **Responsibilities**

Like any role, product managers have responsibilities. Given the breadth of their scope, they have the lion’s share of the responsibility for producing a great product. Product managers are responsible for identifying and assessing opportunities, defining the right product at the right time, developing the product strategy and roadmap, managing the product and its stakeholders, and most importantly, representing the customer. Let’s briefly explore each of these responsibilities.

### Identify and Assess Opportunities

First, it’s a common misunderstanding that product managers are idea guys. This is far from the truth. While they have a good feel for customers’ needs, new product ideas can come from any person, anywhere. The key is to keep an open mind and limit biases when sourcing ideas.

And while product ideas serve as a starting point, ideas are a dime a dozen. Product managers must evaluate opportunities and render go/no-go decisions. There are techniques and tools that can help, but the assessment should capture enough information so executives can understand the decision. Not every opportunity is good, but when it is, it’s time to get to work.

### Right Product/Right Time

Defining the right product at the right time is an art, not a science; this could also be said of product management as a whole.

Considering all factors, from customers to technology to resources, there will be limitations. The product must meet customers’ needs, it should be compelling, and it should be delivered with available technology and resources (personnel and financial). This is a tall order, but this is what product managers do.

Given limitations, product managers use data, experience, and judgement to define a product that can be built in a reasonable amount of time and achieve reasonable success in the market. It’s important to remember that “perfect is the enemy of good.” So product managers must be realistic about the product and lay out the path to build it.

### Product Strategy and Roadmap

Now, ask yourself this: Would you drive somewhere without knowing how to get there? Would you drive somewhere without knowing why? Product managers answer these questions by developing and capturing the product strategy and roadmap.

The product strategy answers “why” the product team is working on the product. Detailing the strategy facilitates a common understanding and provides motivation. This is the source that people will tap into when they are working late nights and weekends.

Meanwhile, the product roadmap answers “how” the product team will realize the strategy. A complete roadmap with milestones and checkpoints provides assurance and visibility for everyone involved. This is what program/project managers will use to ensure product delivery.

While the roadmap may be updated as customers’ needs evolve and markets change, the strategy should be relatively stable. Typically, a shift in product strategy (a pivot) signals a major shift in product definition, and therefore, a new product roadmap will need to be created.

### Manage Product Not People

As the title of the role goes, product managers manage products, not people. Simple. Of course, there are product management managers, directors, and VPs who shape product direction, but they are people managers first.

Product managers are individual contributors who lead the product team, but lack the authority to direct individuals by mandate. Instead, as the owner of the product, product managers influence the product team by communicating their vision and strategy; it comes down to basics like earning trust and persuading with data and logic. The separation of duties creates natural checks and balances between product managers and people managers, and ensures the product gets the attention it deserves and people receive the coaching, mentoring and career development they need to be successful.

### Represent Product Internally

With the ownership we’ve covered so far, it’s easy to focus on building the product. Yet product managers must also engage in stakeholder management because they are responsible for how their product is perceived within the company.

As development proceeds, product managers work with different parts of the organization to communicate the product strategy and roadmap, answer questions, and address concerns. Among other things, they are pulled into executive meetings to review progress, sales and marketing meetings to help them develop their outreach strategies, and engineering planning meetings to plan and prioritize development activities. They are the single point of contact for all things product-related. In effect, the buck stops with the product manager.

### Represent Customer

With everything product managers do, the most important is to serve as the voice of the customer. As it often happens, the product team will encounter numerous decisions during the product development cycle and product managers must ensure outcomes result in a compelling product for the customer. Engineering may want to introduce cognitive friction to reduce operational overhead, sales may hope to expand scope to increase the feature set, and executives may demand pricing adjustments to offset development costs. While not all decisions are imperative, they must be made with the target customer in mind because product managers are only successful when their product meets customers’ needs.

### **Wrap-Up**

As we’ve seen, product success rests on the shoulders of product managers. They are the primary product owners with end-to-end ownership of the product life cycle. They are big thinkers, market experts, and above all, serve as the voice of customers. Product managers share a large scope, interact with multiple stakeholders, communicate their vision and develop a plan to realize it. They define the right product at the right time, one that is compelling and meets the needs of customers. Given this, it takes a special kind of crazy to be a good product manager. In our next post, we’ll take a look at what it takes.
